These libraries provide Obect Oriented access to the DRMAA interface for PBS/Torque. (Or probably any other DRMAA conformant DRM, with minor modification.)

I'm sorry it is neither well documented nor beautiful. I wrote it because I needed it.
Feel free to improve it. If you do so, I would be happy to roll your patches back into the trunk.

To build, type this at the command line:

ant dist
